# My Homelab Wiki

## 1) Introduction 👨🏻‍💻

This GitHub repository is used to store Markdown files (`.md`), which are read by my Wiki.js Kubernetes application.

## 2) Wiki.js 🦋

Wiki.js is a powerful, lightweight, and open-source wiki engine built on Node.js. It features a modern and intuitive interface, supports multiple editing formats (Markdown, WYSIWYG, HTML), and provides advanced access control, integrations, and customization options, making it an ideal solution for documentation and knowledge management.
